	<h1>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM</h1>
	<div class="line dark"></div>
	

	<p>Certain occupations have been, historically and even presently, less representative than others. Generally, thinking about a scientist or a computer programmer elicits the image of a man wearing a white suit or writing some code. Due to systemic discrimination, women are largely underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields in classrooms and cubicles. The numbers are abysmal. </p>

	<div class="list">
		<div class="item">
			<h3>14%</h3>
			<p>female computer science undergraduate at major research</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item">
			<h3>17%</h3>
			<p>female finalists at the ISEF in the computer science category</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item">
			<h3>6</h3>
			<p>women who have won the Nobel prize in Physics or Chemistry</p>

		<div class="item">
			<h3>17.3%</h3>
			<p>women in leadership roles at Microsoft Corporation</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Women empowerment aims to alleviate this problem starting at the school level by encouraging more female students to pursue STEM fields. We want to remind young women that they can also grow up to cure diseases, write computer programs, and ultimately change the world.</p>

	<p>We hope our efforts to encourage more women to pursue STEM fields will go a long way in eliminating gender bias that is prevalent across other industries and occupations.</p>
