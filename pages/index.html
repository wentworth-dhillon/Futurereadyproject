	<h1>THE GENDER GAP IN SCHOOLS AND OFFICES</h1>
	<div class="line red"></div>
	<p>The gender gap in science classrooms in appalling. The ratio of women in is extremely low and far from representative of the population. Moreover, this conditioned is worsened at professional level. We, at Women Empowerment, aim to balance this tilted scales by undertaking active initiatives to motivate more women to take STEM fields at school level. We believe this is a valuable step in fighting the much larger problems of discrimination against and lack of representation of women. Our initiative is a small step towards a much larger cause.</p>

	<h1>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM</h1>
	<div class="line dark"></div>


	<p>Certain occupations have been, historically and even presently, less representative than others. Generally, thinking about a scientist or a computer programmer elicits the image of a man wearing a white suit or writing some code. Due to systemic discrimination, women are largely underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields in classrooms and cubicles. The numbers are abysmal. </p>

	<p>The issue of underrepresentation of women in STEM classrooms and workplaces has become a serious problem. Our initiative as a vital step towards reducing the omnipresent gender gap. We are doing this by talking to the students at school level to understand their motivation or lack of motivation to pursue or not pursue STEM fields. We also conduct information sessions and lecture series in schools to inspire budding scientists. We work with female professionals in the industry to make them a part of this movement as they act can act as mentors. Further we have also organized science exhibitions and quizzes to encourage the participation of female students.</p>
